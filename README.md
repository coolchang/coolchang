👋 Hi, I’m Vincent Kim.
👀 I’m passionate about integrating English education with blockchain-based games, creating cross-platform blockchain games that offer digitally tangible rewards (cryptocurrency) for language learning.
🌱 Currently, I’m exploring gamification, web game development, and blockchain application building.
💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on projects related to educational games and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for equitable education.
📫 Feel free to reach out to me at songnchant@gmail.com.
